== Inspecting the image

In the next steps, you will access the machine image, however it will
not work if the machine image is not yet completed. The below command is
a small `+until+` shell script that will run until the completed machine
image is created.

....
until $(composer-cli compose status | tail -1 | grep FINISHED &>/dev/null); do echo "Compose not finished ... waiting 10 seconds"; sleep 10; done; echo "COMPOSE FINISHED"
....

Now that the machine image compose is finished, download the completed
machine image into your current directory.

....
composer-cli compose image $(composer-cli compose status | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d" ")
....

The above command takes the UUID of the compose as an argument. We
embedded an additional call to `+composer-cli compose status+` along
with some data grooming to put this into the command for you to run.
Alternatively, you could have copy/pasted from the output of your status
from the previous step.

Now that the machine image is available locally, mount the disk image
into your directory tree at the /mnt mountpoint. For this, we will mount
the qcow2 image as a network block device (NBD).

Load the NBD kernel module using the `+modprobe+` utility -

....
modprobe nbd
....

Attach a qcow2 virtual image file that was downloaded into the current
directory -

....
qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 $(composer-cli compose status | cut -f1 -d" " | tail -1)-disk.qcow2
....

Find the virtual machine partition so that we can mount it -

....
fdisk /dev/nbd0 -l
....

The partition of the disk is `+/dev/nbd0p4+`

Mount the partition to some mountpoint (in this case `+/mnt+`) -

....
mount /dev/nbd0p4 /mnt
....

Temporarily change the root directory of the bash shell to be the
directory holding the contents of your machine image.

....
chroot /mnt
....

____
*Note:* You may see the following output:

....
basename: missing operand
Try 'basename --help' for more information.
....

It will not affect the chroot environment or lab.
____

Now, all the commands run are being executed from within the machine
image and use the machine image’s files and content. Use an `+rpm+`
query to confirm that `+nodejs+` and `+nginx+` are included in the
machine image.

....
rpm -q nodejs nginx
....

From the above output, you can verify that both the `+nodejs+` and
`+nginx+` packages were installed into this machine image.

Now that the verification is complete, you can exit the chroot’ed bash
shell.

....
exit
....

Unmount the verified machine disk image from your filesystem.

....
umount /mnt
....

Disconnect the network block device

....
qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
....

Remove the NBD kernel module

....
rmmod nbd
....
