....

Throughout the lab, you have seen the UUID of the compose transaction
used in command output and as an argument for working with individual
machine image operations. The osbuild-composer back-end also uses this
UUID to store data about this, specific, machine image build.

To look at the data associated with the machine image build you
completed in the lab -

....
composer-cli compose results $(composer-cli compose status | cut -f1 -d" " | tail -1)
....

The output is a .tar that includes the logs, status, and resulting
image.

To view the contents of the tar file -

....
tar -tvf $(composer-cli compose status | cut -f1 -d" " | tail -1).tar
....

You will be able to use these logs to isolate problems with a build, add
fixes into your compose file, and reinitiate your build.
