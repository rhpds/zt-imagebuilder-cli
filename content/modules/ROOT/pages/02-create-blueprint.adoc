== Create a blueprint from a file

First, look at what blueprints are available on the system.

....
composer-cli blueprints list
....

This system has no existing blueprints. So, let us go ahead and create a
blueprint.

The `+composer-cli+` will take input as a TOML formatted file (Tomâ€™s
Obvious Minimal Language) that describes the blueprint used to define
our machine image.

To save some time look at the *node-app-server.toml* file that has
already been pre-created using a tool like `+cat+` or `+less+`.

....
cat node-app-server.toml
....

The name of the blueprint is called *node-app-server*. It is recommended
that you also include a description so that others using this blueprint
know what system image they are building. At this point, the blueprint
file does not have any packages but we will add the `+nodejs+` and
`+nginx+` packages to it.

`+nodejs+` is distributed as an application stream for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, so you will need to add a *[[packages]]* section to
the node-app-server.toml file adding `+nodejs+` to the build.

....
printf '\n[[packages]]\nname = "nodejs"\nversion = "*"\n' | sudo tee -a node-app-server.toml
....

The `+printf+` command appends the following formatted stanza to the
node-app-server.toml file.

Similarly, add the `+nginx+` package to the blueprint file.

....
printf '\n[[packages]]\nname = "nginx"\nversion = "*"\n' | sudo tee -a node-app-server.toml
....

In order to create the blueprint from the local TOML file, we will use
the `+blueprints push+` cli option.

....
composer-cli blueprints push node-app-server.toml
....

To verify that your update has been made, review the log of changes made
to the node-app-server blueprint.

....
composer-cli blueprints changes node-app-server
....

*Note:* in the above command output, your date and time will be
different than the date and time that appears in the example output.

You can also review the contents of the node-app-server blueprint to
verify that the `+nodejs+` and `+nginx+` modules are reflected in the
active version of the blueprint instructions.

....
composer-cli blueprints show node-app-server
....

In the above output, you can see that the `+nodejs+` and `+nginx+`
packages are now included in the node-app-server blueprint definition.
