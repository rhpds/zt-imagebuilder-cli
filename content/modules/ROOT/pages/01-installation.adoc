== Install and enable required software

Before you start building images with image builder, the software
required to perform the tasks must be installed on the system.
Specifically, the `+composer-cli+` package which provides the
`+composer-cli+` command, and the `+osbuild-composer+` package which
provides the back-end service used to produce the virtual machine
images.

....
sudo dnf install -y composer-cli osbuild-composer
....

Now that the software has been successfully installed on the system, you
also need to activate the `+osbuild-composer+` service so that the
`+composer-cli+` command can interact with the service that is
responsible for queuing and creating the machine images.

....
sudo systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket
....

Now that the service is accessible, you are ready to start working with
image builder to create machine images.
